### Overview  
***

For this project I created an application that generates a random password based on user selected criteria. The app runs in a browser window and features HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

Through JavaScript I was able to prompt the user with the following password options

- Password length of at least 8 and no more than 128 characters 
- Inclusion of at least one of the following characters:
    - Uppercase 
    - Lowercase 
    - Numerical 
    - Special
